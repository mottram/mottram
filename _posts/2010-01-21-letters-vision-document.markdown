It's been interesting lurking on the [Letters](http://inessential.com/2010/01/16/email_init) mailing list, and I'm really looking forward to trying the application. Fingers crossed the developers (headed up by [Gus Mueller](http://flyingmeat.com/) of Acorn and VoodooPad fame) stick fast to this mission statement.
