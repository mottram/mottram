A "very simple web application to encode and decode unique 64-bit numeric identifiers for a combined set of x, y and z coordinates. Another way to think about that is as a unique ID for any given point at a specific time anywhere on Earth."

So, my 'birthdayplace' is (roughly, because I don't know what time I was born) **17193803388065555992823858920704**.
