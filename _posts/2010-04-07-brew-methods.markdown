A collection of coffee-brewing methods. I'm a wee bit nerdy about making coffee--good beans, roasted in the last week or so, freshly burr ground, brewed in a Chemex--but I'm not at the digital scales, thermometer 'n' timer level. Yet. Though I can safely say I'll never buy [a special Japanese pouring kettle](http://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/products/buono-kettle).
