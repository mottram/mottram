Phillip Garrido, the suspect in the [kidnapping and 18-year imprisonment of Jaycee Lee Dugard](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/us/28abduct.html?hp), kept a weblog, [Voices Revealed](http://voicesrevealed.blogspot.com/). It details his belief that he can control sound waves in order to transmit the voices of angels.

Thanks to Google Street View and Google Maps, you can [watch](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=1554+walnut+ave,+antioch,+ca&daddr=bown+%26+viera,+antioch,+ca&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&sll=38.008597,-121.771473&sspn=0.011006,0.022724&ie=UTF8&ll=38.008459,-121.770549&spn=0.000617,0.00284&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=38.008459,-121.770548&panoid=SIM_k8E4Rv84rEg54dBy4A&cbp=11,0,,0,5.25) a van pull out of the Garrido's driveway and make its way to the nearby crossroads, or look at an aerial view of the  [backyard sheds and tents](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1554+WALNUT+AVE,+antioch,+ca&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=53.477264,55.634766&ie=UTF8&ll=38.00857,-121.77141&spn=0.000411,0.000424&t=h&z=21) where Dugard and her two children were held.

Prurient interest in a disturbing case aside, it's fascinating how easily and quickly one can find context to flesh out a news story--Garrido's [bizarre assertion](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/28/jaycee-lee-dugard-kidnap-suspect-garrido-speaks) that his story is 'heartwarming' makes a lot more sense if you've read his weblog--with a couple of simple searches.
