> Sometimes when I've finished a project I sit down and paint a cartoonish concept drawing with water colours. It is sort of a visual summary that describes the idea of the whole project in just one small piece of paper. I usually say that if you can't tell the story in and A4 sheet of paper (21 by 29.7 cm) you are either doing too much or too complicated stuff.
