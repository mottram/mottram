Fascinating work, but I'd actually prefer AR tech in a pair of specs (which should be possible right now, or very soon, shouldn't it? Translucent <acronym title="Organic Light-Emitting Diode">OLED</acronym> films on the lenses, or something like that). _Via [Guardian Technology](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/sep/02/research-augmented-reality)._
