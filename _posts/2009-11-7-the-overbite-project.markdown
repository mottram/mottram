The Overbite Project make a Firefox add-on that adds Gopher support to current browsers. Strange but true: there are _[more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29#Availability_of_Gopher_today "Wikipedia: Availability of Gopher today")_ Gopher servers [online](gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/world) today than there were in 2007! <strong>Update 11/11/09:</strong> An [Ars Technica piece on Gopher](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/11/the-web-may-have-won-but-gopher-tunnels-on.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss) includes links to a Gopherchan, and a [Gopher Twitter stream](gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/fun/twitpher?segphault).
