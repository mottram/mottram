_Mi Mother Love, Mi Father Love_--Yellowman.

The third in an occasional series of sentimental dancehall songs, and a second outing for Yellowman (a pupil, like so many Jamaican music legends, of [Sister Ignatius][3] at the [Alpha Boy's School][4]).

It's from the album _Yellow Like Cheese_, which is full of cheesy Casio sounds, and has a decidedly cheesy cover:
