I happened upon some late-1990s vintage files yesterday, which I'd written using Appleworks, and saved in the .cwk format. Silly me.

Rather than wade through a load of file format gobbledegook to find the information I needed, I fired up OS 9 (using the excellent [<abbr title="Classic On Intel">COI</abbr>][1], a [SheepShaver][2]-based PowerPC emulator) and enjoyed the peculiar nostalgia of reading pieces I wrote in 1998, in the app I used to write them, on the operating system I used at the time.

Before I shut down the virtual Bondi Blue iMac G3, I took a quick look at this website in the browsers I had handy.

#### iCab 3.0.5

#### Netscape 7.0

#### Internet Explorer for Mac 4.5

Not bad, considering.
