[The Idea of a Tree][1] is:
> ...an autonomous mechanical production process which is a hybrid combination of natural input and mechanical process. It involves the translation of natural inputs through a mechanical apparatus in order to create one object a day. The recorder is totally dependent on sun light. Driven by solar energy, it reacts and incorporates the light intensity into an object.

> The outcoming object reflects the various sunshine conditions that occur during a day. Like a tree the object becomes a three dimensional recording of its process and time of creation.
