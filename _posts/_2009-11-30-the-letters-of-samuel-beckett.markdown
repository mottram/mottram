I'm about halfway through _<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0521867932?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=submirespo-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0521867932">The Letters of Samuel Beckett: Volume I, 1929&#8212;1940</a>_. It's the first in a four volume edition<sup id="f1"><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>, and I _cannot bloody wait_ for the next three.

Even when dashing off a quick note to a mate, Beckett can't help but experiment with language. He coins new words, shows off odd archaisms and crashes French into German into English (sometimes in the same _word_). He flits from scatalogical flights of fancy--writing is constantly compared to having a good solid _merde_--to mean-spirited dismissals of the writers he's reading up<sup id="f2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>. And Beckett is, of course, reading constantly, at fever pitch, filing away phrases and images from whoever crosses his path, be it St. Augustine or Jane Austen (he calls her 'the divine Jane'!).

Reading these letters, it's plain that Beckett is in rehearsal, limbering up for his 'real' writing<sup id="f3"><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>, which he complains is impossible, unbearable. And there's no doubt that these letters foreshadow Beckett's switch from English to French, and reveal, over time, why he _needed_ a second language in which to write his plays and novels.

Here, have a gobbet:

Gorgeous! The line _XXX_ will later appear in XXX, and it looks to me like Beckett is taking the mick out of Joyce, finding his own voice in the process.

The only bum note is the sense that we readers are missing out on material that Fehsenfeld, Overbeck <span class="amp">&amp;</span> co. have enjoyed. Beckett's permission to publish his correspondence only applied to letters 'having bearing on <span>[his]</span> work', which the editors, quite rightly, took to mean 'abso-bloody-lutely everything'. The notoriously prickly Beckett estate didn't agree. So, if you're looking for literary tittle-tattle (which I admit I was), you're out of luck: there's nowt about Beckett's fling with Peggy Guggenheim, nor his ill-fated decision to spurn poor Lucia Joyce, save for hints here and there in the editors' notes.

If you're a fan<sup id="f4"><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>, the _Letters_ are already on your Christmas list, I'm sure. If you're _not_ a fan, the _Letters_ might well change your mind--this isn't the heavy, serious, impenetrable Beckett of the modern canon, it's an exasperating, willfully pretentious, scarily clever junior prof. unhappily groping his way towards greatness.

<li id="n1">Beckett might be famously terse, in much of his writing and in his public life, but privately, he was a right chatterbox: the editors have whittled the available letters down to &#8216;just&#8217; 15,000 for these four volumes, and the foot&#8211; and endnotes refer to, or quote, another 5<abbr title="thousand">K</abbr> or so. <a href="#f1">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n2">Proust really gets it in the neck, dismissed as &#8220;a maudlin false teeth gobble-gobble discharge from a colic-afflicted belly&#8221;. More pithily, Aldous Huxley&#8217;s <em>Point Counter Point</em> gets a more basic treatment, dubbed &#8216;Cunt Counter Cunt&#8217;. <a href="#f2">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n3">In this respect, Beckett is a bit like Burroughs (though in the latter's case, the letters to Ginsberg are far, far better than the fiction that followed). <a href="#f3">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="n4">I am, and have been since school. Which unfortunately means I can't read <em>Endgame</em> without cringing at the memory of a fifth form mini-production of the play, in which I took the r&#244;le of Nag (or maybe Nell), stuffed in a plastic dustbin. <a href="#f4">&#8617;</a></li>
