"The government is to explore ways of making all Ordnance Survey maps freely available online".

Potentially huge news, and not limited to maps: the Guardian report mentions the publication of 2,000 data sets, including information 'owned' by train, tube and bus companies. (I wonder if I'll get the &#163;4.99 I spent on the National Rail Enquiries iPhone app back&#8253;)
