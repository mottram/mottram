[Mapumental](http://mapumental.channel4.com/ "Mapumental") is a fascinating new project by [MySociety.org](http://mysociety.org "Everything they do is clever and useful") and [4iP](http://www.4ip.org.uk/ "Channel 4's public service digital media fund").

Feed it a <abbr>UK</abbr> postcode, and it will generate an interactive [choropleth map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map "A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map"), which lets you see locations highlighted by public transport commute times, house prices and 'scenicness'.
