For the past three years, I've made my daily cup of coffee with [this cheapo Vietnamese drip filter][1]. It's slightly non-standard, lacking the usual screw-down filters, and makes a strong, rough-and-ready brew. I like it--a simple design, completely indestructable, and wonderfully portable.

It's not as beautiful as a [Chemex][2], though. Just look at that. A shining example of what nobody calls 'mid-Century medical' design. Glass, wood, leather; that's all. I don't mind admitting that I mostly bought the thing because it's so pretty, but the fact that coffee nerds rate it highly sealed the deal.

Here are a few Chemex tips I've gleaned from the web and a week's use:

1. **Wash your filter**. This really does make a difference, even to my Benson & Hedges-blunted taste buds. Just pour a load of hot water through the filter, and pour it all out again--you don't even need to remove the filter to do this, thanks to the Chemex' pouring groove. As a side-benefit, this warms the pot, tea-style.

2. **Mind your ratios**. You'll need a lot more coffee than you think if you're used to a cafetière or Vietdripper. I've seen videos online where folk place their Chemex on a digital scale, adding milligram-precise amounts of coffee and water, while precisely timing each step of the brewing process. More power to them, but I say: experiment. My first cup was too weak, my second too strong, every one since has been spot on--for me and my dinky Chemex model, that's about three healthy scoops of coffee to make a mugful.

3. **Go easy on the water**. First you need to dribble a small amount of water onto your grounds, and wait a bit for them to 'bloom'. Then drizzle on some more, all over the grounds, until the water level is almost at the top. Then wait until the coffee is not-quite-dry, and top it up again, pouring into the centre. Sounds fiddly, I know, but it's only three pours from the kettle.

That's it. In three or four minutes, you've got a zingy and fresh-tasting mug of coffee. Yum. A cup brewed with the Chemex isn't _superior_ to coffee brewed with a cafetière, or with my one-cup filter thingy, but it is very different. The clarity of the brew is the first thing I noticed, along with a complete lack of bitterness. And--at the risk of sounding like a gold-plated-interconnects [audiophile][5]--I really can detect a wider variety of flavours and aromas, resulting in a more _complex_ flavour, in a Chemex-brewed cup. 

This must be down to the quality of the Chemex paper filters (or the jump from holes punched in metal to 'unbleached, oxygen cleaned' paper), so I plan to trim one down to fit my Vietnamese job and fashion a cheap-poncey hybrid brewer. You knever know, it might be a coffee revelation.
