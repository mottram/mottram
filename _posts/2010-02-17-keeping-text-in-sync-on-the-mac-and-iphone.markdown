[Quickoffice Mobile Connect Suite](http://blog.quickoffice.com/articles/new-iphone-products-now-available-.html "Quickoffice - New iPhone products now available") launched last week, with an intriguing new feature: [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) integration. Point the app at your Dropbox, and you can create, edit and delete files there; in a second or two, the changes you make take effect in the Dropbox folder(s) on your computer(s).

That's pretty cool. And I reckon it's a sign of some very exciting things to come, too. Here's why: in order to do its stuff, QMCS must be using the as-yet-unreleased [Dropbox API](http://code.google.com/p/dropbox-api/ "A currently empty repository on Google Code"). 

At present, there are many great ways to keep stuff on your Mac synchronised with your iPhone, with the emphasis on 'many': I have to use a total of four applications, and a pair of user accounts, just to make a directory of plain text files on my Mac available in two of my favourite iPhone apps, [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom_iphone) and [Simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/). Which is silly: synchronisation and cloud storage should be platform and application agnostic.

When the Dropbox API launches--it's due [in March](https://www.dropbox.com/votebox/9/dropbox-api "See the first comment, from Arash F."), apparently--it could well put an end to per-app sync solutions, and offer instead synchronisation that 'just works': sign up for one account, and all your files, whatever their format, will be accessible from any application, on any device, that supports Dropbox.

Can't wait.
