A decent explanation of <abbr>DHT</abbr>, <abbr>PEX</abbr> and magnet links, prompted by the Pirate Bay's closure of its tracker. I've been wondering whether magnet links would catch on for yonks. When I [first wrote about them][1] a few years back, I thought they'd eventually become popular, but-- amusingly enough--doubted they'd ever be used in conjunction with the then-newfangled Bittorrent.

<p class="small">In fact, back then I briefly <a title="An old post on Submit Response announcing a konspire2b-powered radio station" href="">hitched my wagon</a> to <a title="The archived konspire site at SourceForge" href="http://konspire.sourceforge.net/">konspire2b</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol that emerged at around the same time as Bittorrent, but was doomed to failure by its publisher/subscriber model. A shame, really&#x2014;konspire2b effectively combined Bittorrent-style peer-to-peer distribution with podcasting, before either were popular. The moral of the story? Never listen to my technology prognostications.</p>
